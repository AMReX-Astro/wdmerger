This directory contains the scripts needed to build and run our test problems.
The `inputs` and `probin` files are makefile sources that include all of the default options
for our CASTRO problems. The `run_utils.sh` script contains all the helper bash routines
needed to execute and submit jobs to various machines, while the `makefile` is included 
in the problem makefiles and contains the helper make targets used to build the problems.
