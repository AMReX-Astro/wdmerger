This directory contains all the test problems we used to assess the performance and algorithms of CASTRO
in the first wdmerger paper.

The `binary/` subdirectory contains problems that specifically test the binary star setup.

The `single/` subdirectory is for single star problems.

The `performance/' subdirectory is about measuring parallel performance.

The `castro/' subdirectory is for building tests in the CASTRO/Exec test suite that are relevant to us.
