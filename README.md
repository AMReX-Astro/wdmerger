*A software package for simulating white dwarf mergers with CASTRO*

This repository contains the scripts used to run simulations of
white dwarf mergers (and related events) in CASTRO. It also contains
the Python scripts used for analysis, and LaTeX documents
for journal submission.

Please contact Max Katz (maximilian.katz@stonybrook.edu) with questions.
General `CASTRO` and `AMReX` questions should be directed
to the `CASTRO` user's mailing list/Google group,
