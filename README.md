# wdmerger
*A software package for simulating white dwarf mergers with CASTRO*

## Getting Started

There is a user's guide in `documentation/` that will guide you 
through installing the required software and running simulations. 
Enter `make` at the command line to build the user's guide. You 
can also find the user's guide (updated nightly) at 
http://astro.sunysb.edu/mkatz/files/wdmergeruserguide.pdf.
