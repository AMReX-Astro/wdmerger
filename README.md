# wdmerger
*a software package for simulating white dwarf mergers with CASTRO*

## Getting Started

There is a user's guide in `documentation/` that will guide you 
through installing the required software and running simulations. 
Enter 'make' at the command line to build the user's guide. You 
will need some LaTeX packages that may not be included by default 
on your system, such as 'natbib'.
