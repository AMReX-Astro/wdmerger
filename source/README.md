Main source files for the wdmerger problem. The `modules/` subdirectory contains the Fortran 
modules that are included in a normal wdmerger run. The `diagnostics/` subdirectory contains 
the scripts needed for runtime diagnostics. You can type `make` in this directory to build 
the full wdmerger problem, but in practice we normally do this in a working problem directory.
