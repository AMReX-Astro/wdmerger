# We can work out the stopping time using the formula

# bc doesn't have a native way to evaluate fractional exponents like square roots,
# so we perform the trick described here:
# http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/bc-and-exponents-containing-decimals-and-fractions-755260/
# The argument is that a^b = exp(b*ln(a)).
# By calling bc with the -l option we include the math library, 
# which knows how to evaluate exponents with e() and logarithms with l().
# The $$() tells the makefile that we want to expand the following in the shell.
# Of course, I could have just used sqrt(2) = 1.414, but where's the fun in that?
