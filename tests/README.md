This directory contains all the test problems we use to assess the performance and algorithms of CASTRO.

The `gravity/` subdirectory contains problems that specifically test the Poisson solver.

The `hydro/` subdirectory contains problems that test hydrodynamics problems, many of which 
are coupled to self-gravity.

The `performance/' subdirectory contains problems that specifically test the parallel 
performance of CASTRO.
