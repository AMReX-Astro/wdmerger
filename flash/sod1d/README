# This is a 1D version of the standard Sod shock tube problem,
# implemented in FLASH version 4.0. It is designed to use the
# Helmholtz EOS. To install this, create a directory in 
# flash/source/Simulation/SimulationMain and put these files in there,
# then setup the problem as usual from the main flash directory.
# The main inputs are sim_rhoLeft, sim_TLeft and sim_uLeft,
# as well as the corresponding quantities on the right side.
